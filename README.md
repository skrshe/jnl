Hi, I'm Anunda, an aspiring game developer / software engineer
and a maker of some things =]. I appreciate simple stuff and
sometimes complex *whojimiwhatsits* (when they work well).

In this subject I plan to pull in my vast and polkadoted
knowledge on programming and actually make some software
`( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`

I'm looking forward to making many many more things...

one of my previous works below:
