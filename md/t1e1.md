# Post a brief introduction about yourself and what you hope to gain out of the subject.
Hi, I'm Anunda, an aspiring game developer / software engineer and a maker of
things that interest me. I appreciate simple stuff and sometimes complex
gadgetry (when they work well).

In this subject I plan to pull in my vast and polka dotted knowledge on
programming and actually make some software `( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )`

I'm looking forward to making many many more things...

One of my previous works below:
