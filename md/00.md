# Post a brief introduction about yourself and what you hope to gain out of the subject.
Hi, I'm Anunda, an aspiring game developer / software engineer and a maker of some things . I appreciate simple stuff and sometimes complex gadgetry (when they work well).

In the past I have made:
- a pseudo laptop using a Raspberry Pi, an ipad mini, a usb power bank and plywood and screws
- A ninja star pizza cutter
- This easily accessible video:

Figure 1

When I saw the empty luggage carousel at an airport on the spur of the moment I thought it would be funny to follow the carousel with the camera on my phone closing in on the note saying the moving carousel was empty.

- many small illustration

I am capable with svg and “OK” at Pixel art

It’s one of the only things I've made that has been “Published”

When I was little I used to draw wild eyed creatures

These creatures have surely influenced my creative practice
But I am yet to get back to a state of easy influence and free flowing thought of a child as of yet

In this subject I plan to pull in my vast and polka dotted knowledge on programming and actually make some nice software.

I'm looking forward to making many many more things...
