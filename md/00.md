# Post a brief introduction about yourself and what you hope to gain out of the subject.
Hi, I'm Anunda, an aspiring game developer / software engineer and a maker of some things . I appreciate simple stuff and sometimes complex gadgetry (when they work well).

In the past I have made:

- a pseudo laptop using a Raspberry Pi, an ipad mini, a usb power bank and plywood and screws
- A ninja star pizza cutter
- many small illustration
- This easily accessible video:

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="1280" height="864" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_pksmsTEmQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Figure 1

The video above was from a time when I saw the empty luggage carousel at an airport
on the spur of the moment I thought it would be funny to follow the carousel
with the camera on my phone closing in on the note saying the moving carousel
was empty. later when exploring youtube I decided to try upload it to test how
youtube uploading works.

The video one of the only things I've made that has been “Published”.


I think I am capable with svg and “OK” at Pixel art
When I was little I used to draw wild eyed creatures
now I many draw scribbles and am seamingly unable to use lower thought
( I feel like a Machine =( )


In this subject I plan to pull in my vast and polka dotted knowledge on
programming and rekindle my mythical drawing skills while learning to make
something cool.

I'm looking forward to making many many more gadgets and dohickies.
