## Post a brief introduction about yourself and what you hope to gain out of the subject.
Hi, I'm Anunda, an aspiring game developer / software engineer and a
maker of some things =]. I appreciate simple stuff and
sometimes complex _whojimiwhatsits_ (when they work well).

\
In this subject I plan to pull in my vast and polkadoted knowledge on programming
and actually make some software `( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`

\
I'm looking forward to making many many more things...
